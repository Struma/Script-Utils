# Script-Utils

**This folder contains Scripts I wrote to make my life easier or better in some way.**

Scripts are baisically programs written in an interpreted language. 

They are a lot more than that, but I think they are distinct from full fledged programs (compiled or interpreted) because they are usually a set of commands run in a single file. I would distinguish a Python program as being larger and more comprehensive in its character. A script usually does something mundaine that needs to be done often, they are great for linux users because we can schedule scripts to run using a timetable (crontab or anacron) to do things like backup and update the system at regular intervals. 

# Scripts in Bash, Python, and R

1. **Bash** is king of scripting - All power users must know

* The bash shell is the most comfortable shell I've ever used. The shell is the gateway to the system, might as well learn to use it in all it's capacities

2. **Python** is therefore the queen - All children should be taught this in school 

* Python is the best and greatest programming language I've ever used. It is stupid easy to learn on any system and a good starting point for children and older students.

3. **R** is for stats - All math and science people should know

* R is only worth knowing if you like math and science and use it in your daily life. I do a lot of data visualization, and while python can do that, R is far better and much sexier.
